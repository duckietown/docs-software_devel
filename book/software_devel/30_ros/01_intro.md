# Introduction to ROS {#ros-intro status=draft}

Maintainer: Russell Buchanan

Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework for software development on robots. It is widely used research and industry and we use it for running our duckiebots.

This guide will go over the ROS conventions used in Duckietown as well as point out some useful tools for developing with ROS. If you are looking for a general guide to ROS there already exist excellent tutorials on the [official wiki](wiki.ros.org).
