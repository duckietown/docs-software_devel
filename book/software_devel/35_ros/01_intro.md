# Introduction to ROS {#ros-intro status=ready}

Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework for software development on robots. It is widely used research and industry and we use it for running our duckiebots.

This guide will give an overview of ROS specific to Duckietown as well as point out some useful tools for developing with ROS. If you are looking for a general guide to ROS there exist excellent tutorials on the [official wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/).

Additionally there is a course at ETHZ [Programming for Robotics - ROS](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) although they use C++.
